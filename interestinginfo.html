        <p1>Tim Berners-Lee created the first-ever website
            The first email was sent way before the invention of the World Wide Web. However, after the invention, the sharing of information via the internet was highly upgraded. After the browser and servers were ready for use, the first website was launched.
            Tim Berners-Lee was not aimed to gain profit from his invention
            Unlike several inventors like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Alan Sugar, Tim Berners-Lee’s invention was meant to help. In several interviews, he claimed to have been in the right place at the right time.
            Tim Berners-Lee’s parents were scientists
            He was born to Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. They were both computer scientists as well as mathematicians. The two were among the fore bench members who joined hands to develop a computer.
            Tim Berners-Lee had come up with other names other than the World Wide Web
            At first, the development was aimed to come up with a hypertext project. He later wrote that he wanted to develop an information linking system called ENQUIRE. This was sourced from a book by his parents, ‘Enquire within upon everything. </p1>
